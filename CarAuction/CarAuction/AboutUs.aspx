        <b>ABOUT Car Auction</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        South Africa's call for vehicle transactions to become a rewarding experience has
        been heard... and answered! The days of Vehicle Prices being dictated to you are
        over, Carbid allows the public to bid online on vehicles all over south Africa advertised
        by willing sellers, as long as you are a willing buyer and the seller accepts your
        bid, the car is yours!<br />
        <br />
        Car Auction allows you all the same features as conventional sites, which you are
        free to use, but the live bidding facility gives you much more power in choosing
        YOUR vehicle at the right price.<br />
        <br />
        You have 2 choices when it comes to auctioning your vehicle online, Sell your car
        at a retail value or sell it at a trade value. The retail option entails you selling
        your vehicle at the same price as what the dealer networks would sell it for, but
        bear in mind you are then competing against dealers who allow the buyer recourse
        and has the ability to offer services an individual perhaps cannot. The Trade option
        allows you to offer your vehicle to the public, or willing dealers to buy your vehicle
        at wholesale prices and almost allows for a <b>GAURANTEED</b> sale to take place. Bear
        in mind bidders will be bidding against each other, and bids will close after 7
        days, if the seller has not already accepted an offer and ratified the transaction
        before then.<br />
        <br />
        Use our convenient powerful search facilities to track down your dream car and start
        bidding right away, or sign in and load your vehicle onto the site to get buyers
        to bid on your vehicle... fast. Our Dealer network will bid on your car, as will
        the public and believe us when we say somewhere out there, there is a buyer for
        your trade in, This is the satisfaction networking has to offer <b>EVERYONE</b>.<br />
